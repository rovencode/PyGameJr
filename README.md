# Welcome to PyGameJr

PyGameJr is for kids who would like to create 2D games. It is very easy to use but still powerful! It removes a lot of  complicated looking code needed for PyGame. If you were using Scratch then you will find familier functions like `turn`, `glide`, `look` etc. You will also find familier concepts like `costumes` so it is more easier to transition to powerful coding environment like Python!


## How to Install

We highly recommand [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to install Python and use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as editor for writing and debugging code.

To install PyGameJr, just clone this repo and use pip command like this:

```
git clone https://github.com/sytelus/PyGameJr.git
cd PyGameJr
pip install -e .
```

## What do I do Next?

Open the PyGameJr directory in your editor like VS Code. You will see examples folder in there. Click on individual example Python files and run it. Study the code, modify and enjoy!
